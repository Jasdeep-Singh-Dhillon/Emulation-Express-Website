						Each computer consists of hardware and software. By integrating these two components a computer
						can offer a wide range of possibilities, like creating office documents, surfing the web and
						playing games. The strong dependency between hardware and software also introduces a risk. If
						one of these fails, it will have influence on the computerâ€™s operation and thereby its
						capabilities. As each hardware device eventually will break down, accessibility to digital
						objects is at stake. Emulation offers a solution to this problem.
					</p>
					<p>
						Emulation is best described as imitating a certain computer platform or program on another
						platform or program. In this manner, it is possible to view documents or run programs on a
						computer not designed to do so. An emulator is itself a program that creates an extra layer
						between an existing computer platform (host platform) and the platform to be reproduced (target
						platform), as pictured in Figure

					<h4>Digital Preservation</h4>
					<p>
						When dealing with digital preservation there are basically two possible strategies: migration
						and emulation. Where emulation focuses on recreating the original computer environment,
						migration adapts the original digital document to the current known computer environment.
						Although original attributes can be lost, it allows easier access to the document than using an
						emulated environment.
					</p>
					<p>
						Migration is best applied to relatively simple objects such as text documents and images.
						However, complex objects like the latest generation of PDF files, websites and computer
						applications, are often strongly dependent on layout and functionality. Especially these
						attributes may be affected during a migration process. That is, functionality like user
						interaction or the interaction of a program with a computer platform may show significant
						problems. Another disadvantage of migration is that it has to be carried out on a regular basis,
						which increases the chance of errors.
					</p>
					<p>
						Emulation is difficult, the main reason why it is not applied on a large scale in digital
						preservation. Developing an emulator is a precise and time-consuming task, especially because
						the emulated environment must appear authentic and must function accurately too. If future users
						are interested in the contents of a file, migration remains the better option. When it is the
						authentic look and feel and functionality of a file they seak, emulation is worth the effort.
						This can be the case with PDF documents or websites. For multimedia applications, emulation is
						in fact the only suitable preservation strategy as they require a full operating environment
						just like the one it was created for.
