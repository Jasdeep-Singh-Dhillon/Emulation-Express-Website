						A Virtual Machine (VM) is a compute resource that uses software instead of a physical computer
						to run programs and deploy apps. One or more virtual “guest” machines run on a physical “host”
						machine. Each virtual machine runs its own operating system and functions separately from the
						other VMs, even when they are all running on the same host. This means that, for example, a
						virtual MacOS virtual machine can run on a physical PC.
					</p>
					<p>
						Virtual machine technology is used for many use cases across on-premises and cloud environments.
						More recently, public cloud services are using virtual machines to provide virtual application
						resources to multiple users at once, for even more cost efficient and flexible compute.

					<h4>Uses</h4>
					<p>
						Virtual machines(VMs) allow a business to run an operating system that behaves like a completely
						separate computer in an app window on a desktop. VMs may be deployed to accommodate different
						levels of processing power needs, to run software that requires a different operating system, or
						to test applications in a safe, sandboxed environment.
					</p>
					<p>
						Virtual machines have historically been used for server virtualization, which enables IT teams
						to consolidate their computing resources and improve efficiency. Additionally, virtual machines
						can perform specific tasks considered too risky to carry out in a host environment, such as
						accessing virus-infected data or testing operating systems. Since the virtual machine is
						separated from the rest of the system, the software inside the virtual machine cannot tamper
						with the host computer.
